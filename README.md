### etc branch
This `etc` branch is the experimental one. Here you can find new logos.

### Save as Plain SVG and use pixels (px) as units

All these files are saved as plain SVG (Inkscape > File > Save As... Plain SVG). This makes the files smaller without loosing any important data. Except one information: all units are in pixels. Everything was made using round numbers here. There is no such thing as `x=1.234 px` anywhere here. Prior to doing any edit, please set your document and tool units to pixels and use only round numbers.

### Why do i keep changing the logo again and again ?

I kept changing the logo again and again, trying new versions, because i was not satisfied. And because all my past propositions got rejected. I think i finally have created a good one: this arobas-green.svg and all the other arobas* variants. I would be very surprised these arobas* logos would be officially approved, but at least now i can say i tried, and now i can just forget this. I lost a big part of my summer into this.

What is a good logo? A good logo has some meaning, carries some values, in an obvious or hidden manner. And these symbols and values should correspond to the entity the logo represents, of course. That is what logo design is all about. And this logo must be simple, to be quickly recognizable even when printed small or seen from far. And, of course, it must be technically well done, mastered. Well, the old LinuxMint logo from 2007 had none of these requirements. It doesn't mean anything, does not carry any values, is not well created, the SVG file is a mess, and, on top of that, it is ugly.

So, i tried to create a new one. I had one that i thought was pretty good, back in 2018, but it never made it to the official repositories. So, i kept searching. I have created a few good logos. This one here on the front page, and a few other ones that you can find in the sub-directories. But the LinuxMint team will not take them, because they already have about a dozen of logos available on https://github.com/linuxmint/brand-logo. But that is precisely one of the main dispute i am having with the Mint team. In my humble opinion, there should be just one logo, with a few similar variants for colors and with or without the full name. Just one logo. Not twelve. Just one logo, but preferably, a good one.
